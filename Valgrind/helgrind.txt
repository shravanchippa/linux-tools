Helgrind can detect three classes of error. Firstly, it can detect the incorrect use
of the API. For example, it can unlock a mutex that is already unlocked, unlock a
mutex that was locked by a different thread, not checking the return value of certain
Pthread functions. Secondly, it monitors the order in which threads acquire locks
and thus detects potential deadlocks which could arise from the formation of cycles
of locks. Finally, it detects data races which can happen when two threads access a
shared memory location without using suitable locks or other synchronization to
ensure single-threaded access.


Using Helgrind is simple, you just need this command:
# valgrind --tool=helgrind <program>
