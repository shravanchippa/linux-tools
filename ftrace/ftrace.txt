Using Ftrace Before you can use Ftrace, you have to mount the debugfs filesystem
which, by convention, goes in the /sys/kernel/debug directory:

# mount â€“t debugfs none /sys/kernel/debug
All the controls for Ftrace are in the /sys/kernel/debug/tracing directory; there
is even a mini HOWTO in the README file.
This is the list of tracers available in the kernel:

# cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/available_tracers
blk function_graph function nop

The active tracer is shown by current_tracer, which, initially, will be the null
tracer, nop.
To capture a trace, select the tracer by writing the name of one of the
available_tracers to current_tracer, then enable tracing for a short while,
as shown here:

# echo function > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/current_tracer
# echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/tracing_on
# sleep 1
# echo 0 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/tracing_on


In that one second, the trace buffer will have been filled with the details of every
function called by the kernel. The format of the trace buffer is plain text, as described
in Documentation/trace/ftrace.txt. You can read the trace buffer from the trace
file:

# cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace
# tracer: function
#
# entries-in-buffer/entries-written: 40051/40051 #P:1
